# NodeJS - Study and tests

Source: https://nodeschool.io/

I've done these exercises to study and so I think they are interesting for begginers and can be very usefull, including to remember basic concepts.

You can also install them as a Node module, because this way your answers in the exercises will be automaticaly checked.

Or just install ```npm install -g javascripting```
